[describe the steps a user needs to do to get the system into a usable state for someone
to then be able to follow the documentation for end users, who typically won't be configuring
the application in the admin, but just using it.]

[end with a link to the tutorial for users, /user/index]

Example content::

    Create a django CMS page to hook the Aldryn Jobs application into. In its *Advanced settings*,
    set its ``Application`` to *Jobs*, and use the provided, default *Jobs / aldryn_jobs* in
    ``Application configurations`` before saving.

    The page is now a landing page for vacancies; it will be empty until you create some.

    The behaviour of the Jobs system should be largely self-explanatory, but the :doc:`tutorial for
    users </user/index>` will guide you through some basic steps if necessary.
